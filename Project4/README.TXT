IMPORTANT: Input File Placement

To run the program using the provided sample_input.txt file, make sure the file is placed in your project’s root directory (the same folder that contains your src/ directory), NOT inside src/.

For Eclipse Users:
- Right-click the project name in the Package Explorer.
- Choose "Show in > System Explorer" (or Finder on macOS).
- Move sample_input.txt into that folder.
- Now you can run your program and it should correctly locate the input file.

If you put the file in the wrong place (e.g., inside src/), the program may throw a FileNotFoundException unless you specify a full path.
